      <p class="mission">The <strong>mission</strong> of the <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/2018/distributed-tracing/">Distributed Tracing Working Group</a> is to
        define standards for interoperability between tracing tools. A tracing tool refers to a tool which is implemented as
        either a library or an agent to provide at least one of the following capabilities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Propagation of the context identifying a trace, i.e. an interaction with an application;</li>
        <li>Modification of trace information to indicate that additional trace information is available;</li>
        <li>Collection of tracing information for a specific trace.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>Interoperability for tracing therefore refers to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A standardized way to propagate vendor-specific tracing information across tiers instrumented with different tracing
          tools;</li>
          <li>A standardized and extensible format to share trace data &mdash; full traces or fragments of traces &mdash; across
            tools for
            further interpretation.</li>
      </ul>

          <h2>Scope</h2>
          <p>
            Modern cloud-native applications are highly distributed and often span multiple technology and vendor boundaries.
            The complexity
            of these applications requires a detailed understanding of how individual requests are executed. This is referred
            to as "distributed tracing".
            </p>
            <p>
            Tracing tools for collecting this information have been available for quite some time. However, these tools have not
            been
            built with interoperability in mind. This leaves the developer with a number of challenges in getting an end-to-end
            trace of complex transactions:
          <ul>
            <li>Traces are often broken, because trace context information is lost in a contributing tier or the trace is
              restarted</li>
            <li>Vendors cannot pass proprietary information across tiers instrumented with a different implementation and
              therefore
              lose relevant information (e.g. step count, server information, ...)</li>
            <li> End users don't have the ability to create complete end-to-end traces of application transactions which are
              monitored
              by different tools, as there is no defined data format and semantics for trace data</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Components of cloud-native application can be browser-hosted single page applications, mobile apps, server
            components implemented in various
            languages and externally hosted SaaS applications. Those components communicate using various protocols. Variety of
            technologies
            and platforms calls for standardization of protocols used to implement distributed tracing scenarios.
            </p>
            <p>
              The scope of this working group is the definition of data formats and headers enabling the propagation and correlation
              of
              tracing data across different implementations.
              </p>

              <p>Each specification should contain a section detailing any known security or privacy implications for implementers,
                Web authors, and end users.</p>
            <p>Each specification also has a related test-suite defining compliant behavior of implementations. The test-suite is
              built so implementations can easily be tested for compliant behavior. </p>

            Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from
            teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review,
            and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to
            by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public
            repository,
            and may permit direct public contribution requests. The meetings themselves are not open to public participation,
            however.

            <p>
            Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and
            meetings) will
            be available from the

            </p>
            <p>
            Most Distributed Tracing Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and
            will be
            conducted on an as-needed basis.
            </p>
            <p>
              This group primarily conducts its technical work
            <a id="public-github" href="https://github.com/w3c/distributed-tracing">GitHub issues</a>. The public is invited to
            review, discuss and contribute to this work.
            </p>
            <p>
            The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the
            Chairs and
            members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

            Decision Policy
          </h2>
          <p>
            This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process#Consensus">
              W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal,
            which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little
            formal voting being required.
            </p>
            <p>
            However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration
            of the
            range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.
            </p>
            <p>
            To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions)
            taken
            in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for consensus (CfC) will be
            issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week
            to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue. If no objections are
            raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus
            as a resolution of the Working Group.
            </p>
            <p>
            All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or
            unless
            reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
            </p>
            <p>
              This charter is written in accordance with the
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and
            includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document
            requires.
