# Join Distributed Tracing Working Group

We welcome you to join the Distributed Tracing working group. This group works on
standards to improve monitoring and troubleshooting of modern distributed
applications also known as micro-services. These standards will help web
framework developers, web servers, proxies and load balancers as well as tracing
vendors.

There are many ways to [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) to the specifications developed
by this working group and the future of distributed tracing: you can provide
feedback, improve test coverage, join working group meetings, review specs,
build prototypes, and promote the group's work.

If your employer is a member of W3C - officially joining the working
group is a best way to promote your work. Listing company as a [group
participant](https://www.w3.org/2000/09/dbwg/details?group=108594&order=org&public=1)
makes your company's contributions and endorsements more discoverable. And, as a
result, specifications produced by the group will be more credible.

Joining the group will allow you to vote on major decisions and influence
this group charter.
